Larry O'Heron will present **Design Patterns**

Ever been stuck at trying to figure out how to structure your code to work a certain way? Chances are, someone has already solved the problem for you and can guide you down the path!

Design Patterns are like recipes to common architectural issues you might be facing in your code. Notice that they are called patterns, not solutions, because they need to be adapted to your problem space. Learning to recognize when and how to apply a design pattern is crucial to becoming a successful developer.

**Larry** is a .NET Lead Analyst for the Laboratory for Laser Energetics at the University of Rochester. He develops instrumentation control software and analysis/reduction algorithms for laser fusion research. His software operates/controls 20+ scientific instruments and stores MB image data from laser-impact studies on cryogenic targets and laser-induced damage to optics.

Retiring from the U.S. Navy as a Russian linguist in 1994, Larry earned a B.S. in Computer Science and an M.S. in Professional Development (Human-Computer Interface) from RIT.
